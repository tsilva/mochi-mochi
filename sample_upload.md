**Question:**

What is gradient descent?

**Answer:**

Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used to minimize the loss function in machine learning models by iteratively moving in the direction of steepest descent as defined by the negative of the gradient.

**Question:**

What is the difference between L1 and L2 regularization?

**Answer:**

L1 regularization (Lasso) adds the absolute value of coefficients as a penalty term, which can lead to sparse models (some weights become exactly zero). L2 regularization (Ridge) adds the squared value of coefficients as a penalty term, which tends to shrink weights but not make them exactly zero.

**Question:**

What is the purpose of a validation set in machine learning?

**Answer:**

A validation set is used to tune hyperparameters and evaluate model performance during training without using the test set, helping to prevent overfitting and select the best model configuration before final evaluation.
